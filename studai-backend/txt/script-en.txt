[EN] Oh shit, I almost gave away my whole damn storage live on stream. I’m talking broadcasting, vibing, and without even noticing I dropped an API key in the chat. And of course—boom—chaos unleashed. Random people jumping in, files flying all over. Learned that lesson in like five minutes and a couple million views.

Listen. There are two worlds in the cloud. Keys? Those fuckers are like physical keys. Simple, direct… but if they leak? Kaboom, everything’s compromised. RBAC is a whole different beast. You’re giving roles, not keys. Identities, permissions, fine-grained control. Auto-rotation, clean-ass audit logs. In Azure you’ve got Managed Identities. The service authenticates itself—no secret handling. Magic-level shit.

Quick tips between stream and chaos-memes:
– Don’t drop your damn keys in chat.
– Use roles and least privilege like your life depends on it.
– Whatever secrets you must keep, toss them in Key Vault.
– Check access the same way you check weird donation messages.

Plot twist: the “hacker” viewer who jumped in? Dude actually helped me set up RBAC properly. Now I’m safer and more viral.

If you play with keys, you’re basically leaving the door wide the fuck open… for everyone.
